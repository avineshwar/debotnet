ID=Classic Sticky Notes for Windows 10
Ver=1.0
Desc=In Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft replaced the classic desktop Sticky Notes app with a Universal app (UWP). For many users, the traditional Desktop app is the preferable option. It consumes notably fewer system resources, it starts immediately and works much faster, and has no Cortana integration.\n\nIf you would like to get back the classic Sticky Notes desktop app in Windows 10, just use the provided installer from Winaero. The package supports both Windows 10 32-bit and Windows 10 64-bit. It comes with almost the full set of MUI files, so it will be in your native language out-of-the-box.\n\nThis script will ONLY download the provided installer from Debotnet's GitHub repository.
